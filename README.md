# Cantonese Flashcard PWA

A Progressive Web Application for learning Cantonese through interactive flashcards with audio pronunciations. The app displays Jyutping (pronunciation), English translations, and Chinese characters with authentic Cantonese audio using Azure Text-to-Speech.

## Features

- üìù Flashcard-based learning interface
- üîä Audio pronunciations using Azure TTS
- üåê Progressive Web App (PWA) support for offline use
- ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard navigation support
- üì± Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- üîÑ Flip cards to reveal English/Chinese translations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Azure Text-to-Speech API key (for generating new audio files)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```powershell
git clone <repository-url>
cd canto-app
```

2. Create and set up environment variables:
```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```
Then edit the `.env` file and add your Azure credentials:
```
AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=your_azure_speech_key_here
AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=your_azure_region_here
```

3. Install Python dependencies:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Generate audio files (only needed once):
```powershell
python generate_cantonese_azure_tts.py
```

5. Start the local server:
```powershell
python server.py
```

6. Open your web browser and visit:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

### Development Setup

The project is configured with Git to keep sensitive data and generated files local:

- `.env` file contains Azure credentials and is not tracked
- `audio/` directory with generated MP3 files is excluded from Git
- `.env.example` provides a template for environment variables

When contributing:
1. Never commit the `.env` file
2. Keep audio files local (they can be regenerated)
3. Update `requirements.txt` if you add new dependencies
4. Test the app with a fresh clone to ensure setup instructions work

### Usage

- Click the play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) to hear the Cantonese pronunciation
- Click "Flip Card" or press spacebar to reveal the English translation and Chinese characters
- Use arrow keys or navigation buttons to move between cards
- Install as a PWA through your browser for offline access

## Technical Details

### Audio Generation

The project uses Azure Cognitive Services Text-to-Speech to generate Cantonese pronunciations. To generate new audio files:

1. Update `words.csv` with new vocabulary
2. Configure your Azure credentials in `generate_cantonese_azure_tts.py`
3. Run the script to generate new audio files:
```powershell
python generate_cantonese_azure_tts.py
```
4. Azure AI Speech Studio features different voices [Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal/147c01fc25d24cc88641e7c90a99a6ef/voicegallery), selecting a voice and accessing sample code will reveal the voice name that must be used in the generate_cantonese_azure_tts.py script

### PWA Support

The application includes:
- Service worker for offline functionality
- Web manifest for installation
- Cache management for assets and audio files
